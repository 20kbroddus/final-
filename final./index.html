          Millions of Ukrainians are Displaced as the War with Russia Continues
        </h1>
        <h2> 
          The lives of millions of Ukrainians have been turned upside down due to Russia's invasion. Millions have fled the country, but many are stuck and have been displaced from the cities they once called home.

          In 2021, Afghanistan citizens were fleeing their country as fighting escalated when the Taliban took power. There were approximately 700,000 Afghan refugees in the year 2021 alone. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In comparison, 5.6 million people have fled from Ukraine in just more than two months since Russia invaded.

          On February 24, 2022 Russia invaded its neighboring country Ukraine in hope to overthrow the Ukrainian government as well as to diminish Ukraine’s wish to join the Western defensive alliance NATO. Since the invasion, there have been over 3,000 civilian casualties and more than 3,000 civilian injuries. Two-thirds of Ukraine’s population had previously lived in cities, but the ongoing war made cities into battlefields.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Millions of Ukrainians have fled from their homes to various countries in Europe including Poland, Belarus, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. The United States has the fourth highest amount of Ukrainian diaspora behind Russia, Canada, and Poland. However, the ability to get to the United States directly from Ukraine has proven very difficult. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Anna Salewycz is a second generation Ukrainian student at Syracuse University who is very passionate about her Ukrainian culture. Salewycz grew up in the Ukrainian community in Clifton, New Jersey and has friends all around the country whom she connected with through the Ukrainian Community Centers. Salewycz has distant relatives in Ukraine, and many of her friends have immediate family still in Ukraine. “It is so difficult to leave,” Salewycz said. “For the most part people are leaving to go to other European countries and then coming to America.” 
        </p> <br>

          The city of Syracuse is a sanctuary city that already opened its arms to welcome any Ukrainian refugees. New York state has the biggest Ukrainian population within the United States and the city of Syracuse is tied for first in having the highest number of Ukrainians in all major New York metropolitan areas. 

        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the fact that Syracuse is ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees, none have come yet. 

        </p>

        <p>
          Patricia Burak, a native of Syracuse and a member of the lively Ukrainian community, explains that the Syracuse Ukrainian community is ready for refugees when they make it to Syracuse, “People have made contact with refugee agencies offering their homes and resources. But to my knowledge no refugees have come yet.”
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Burak, the Syracuse Ukrainian community has done an outstanding job of raising money and sending things to Ukraine. Regardless of being an ocean away, the vast Ukrainian community in the United States is eager to help those both in Ukraine and those trying to leave Ukraine. 
        </p>

        <p>
          While millions of Ukrainians have been able to flee and arrive in other European countries, not everyone has been able to leave. 7.7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced since the war began. The majority of the internally displaced people are located in the western region of Ukraine.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Within Salewyzc’s Ukrainian community, there are many people with family and friends in Ukraine, “My one friend was born in Ukraine and her friends are still there. They were texting her when the war broke out. They were texting her saying ‘Oh my god three blocks away just got bombed.’”  
        </p> <br>

      <iframe title="Internally Displaced People in Ukraine" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-1wgPJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1wgPJ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="489"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

        <br><p>
          Both Anna Salewyzc and Patricia Burak stressed how important their Ukrainian culture has always been to them. Burak is the faculty moderator for the Ukrainian Club at Syracuse University and Salewyzc is a member of the club.         </p>

        <p>
          Burak explains the significance that the club holds for many members, “The club on campus was specifically designed to build connections with students from Ukraine or with Ukrainian backgrounds. It provides community support.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Having a community to be a part of is a very significant aspect of Ukrainian culture as a whole. There is a Ukrainian Youth Group across the world that puts so many people in contact with one another. Salewyzc’s community back home packages medical kits among other things for soldiers, as well as attends protests in New York City and locally in New Jersey. 

        </p>

        <p>
          The community and pride that Ukrainians have in their culture is evident all around the world. When the war broke out in Ukraine, Salewycz remembers talking with her Ukrainian friend from New York City who had family in Ukraine, “Her parents were born in Ukraine and all of their friends and family are there. When the war broke out her parents were looking up flights to go and fight in Ukraine,” Salewyzc stated.

        </p>

        <p>
          “Their blood is there,” Salewyzc said. “I can only imagine how difficult it is for people who have family over there.” 
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though Salewyzc has never been to Ukraine, ultimately she says it is her home and plans to visit in the future. 
        </p>
